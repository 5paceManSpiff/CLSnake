### What is CLSnake?

CLSnake is a small snake clone written in python 3 with the curses module.  I wrote this as to refamiliarize myself with python and its curses library.  This is in no way that great of an implimentation, though it's simple enough to be read by beginners.  Feel free to browse or download the code.
